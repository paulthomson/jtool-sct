# JTool SCT (A Java tool for systematic concurrency testing)

## Getting started

* git clone this repository to a directory. E.g. `/data/java/jtool-sct`. 

 We will refer to this direcory as `$JTOOL_ROOT`.

* Install JDK 7. E.g.
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk openjdk-7-source
```
Note: the tool probably won't work with JDK 8. On Windows, you can download and install the latest version of Oracle's JDK 7.

* Download Maven and extract it somewhere. E.g. `/data/java/maven`.

* In `$JTOOL_ROOT`, copy `template_env.sh` (or `template_env.cmd` if on Windows) to `env.sh` (or `env.cmd` if on Windows). Edit the environment variables at the top of the file to match your environment. 

* From a terminal, source `env.sh`:
```bash
$ source env.sh
```
 On Windows, you can "execute" it from a command prompt:
```c
> env.cmd
```
* Java 7 and Maven should now be on your path. E.g.:

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_85"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.6.1) (7u85-2.6.1-5ubuntu0.15.04.1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.85-b03, mixed mode)

```

* You should now be able to execute the following commands one after the other (the output has been omitted):

```
$ build_all
$ instr_rt
$ install_rt
```

`build_all` builds jtool and all benchmarks. `instr_rt` instruments the current JDK 7 runtime jar and places it in the `$JTOOL_ROOT/temp` directory. `install_rt` places the instrumented jar in the local maven repository so that it be found easily. Look at the env file if you want to see what these commands actually do.

* You can now execute a test harness, replacing `java` with the `jtool` command:
```
$ jtool example.SimpleHarness
```

* TODO: Include a simple example harness.

* The included test harness that executes all the benchmarks is:
 
 `$JTOOL_ROOT/projects/runbenchmarks/src/main/java/runbenchmarks/MainHarness.java`

To execute this, you should load the Maven projects in `$JTOOL_ROOT/projects` into an IDE, such as IntelliJ, and run `MainHarness.java`. This approach ensures all the necessary jar files are on the classpath. You should add the following JVM arguments to the run configuration:

`-Xbootclasspath/p:$M2_REPO/org/jtool/local/rt/1/rt-1.jar -javaagent:$M2_REPO/org/jtool/jtool-runtime/0.1/jtool-runtime-0.1.jar`

You will probably need to manually replace $M2_REPO with the actual location of your Maven repository. You may also need to be careful that your IDE runs the harness using JDK 7 and that your Maven installation is used (instead of the IDE's included Maven installation).
